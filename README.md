# Lane-Detection
The lane detection has proved to be an efficient technique to prevent accidents in Intelligent Transportation Systems. The review on lane detection has shown that most of the researchers have neglected the problem of the fog and noise in images. Thus noise and fog may reduce the accuracy of the existing systems.

## Technology Stack
- OpenCV
## Libraries required for this task:
1. Numpy
2. Matplot

# Hough Transformation
The Hough transform is a technique in which features are extracted that is used in image analysis and digital image processing. It is used to detect the geometrical shapes such as straight line, circle, and many more.

# Edge Detection
Edge detection works on the idea of the identification of points in the digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply. Edge detection is a fundamental tool in image processing particularly in the areas of feature detection and feature extraction.

# Bilateral Filter 
Bilateral filter is a simple and non-iterative scheme which smoothens the image while preserving the edges. The basic idea behind the working of bilateral filter is that the two pixels should be close to one another.This filter split an image into large-scale features i.e. structure and small scale features i.e. texture.
